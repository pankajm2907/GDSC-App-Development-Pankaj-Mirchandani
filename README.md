# GDSC-App-Development-Pankaj-Mirchandani
Submission for GDSC recruitment for app development department by Pankaj Mirchandani 
I have made an all inclusive app not only of rthe college campus but it also acts as a student portal of sorts 
so we start with the login phase

it is a very robust login process able to take both phone no. and email to verify the user account
Now location permission is required in order to track data of all students to map the college campus after a month when the data is mapped this feature can be disabled when not using the classroom finding feature

Finally we are on our homepage with four potential pathways to take thereon
we shall explore each of them one by one

First lets check out the canteen and see what it has in store for the students

In the canteen the student can either just check the menu or actually order food for pick up at the canteen
If the student decides to order a pick up they can either pay at that time using payment portals like razor pay which can utilise credit cards,debit cards, upi,etc.
or the student can pay at the counter 
Lets check out the classroom finder now

This feature will be ready to work once we map out the campus using data from student devices after which data should stop exporting and the feature should become available for the convenience of the students 
Here we are seeing the student portal feature which is one of the main features making this app and one stop shop

A student can manage and see their attendance, submit and check assignment, and also check changes in timetable.
The next feature is the students favourite social and newsletter feature

in the social feature students are able to find and interact with each other. the best feature here is that students can directly contact faculty for their doubts, keeping spam in mind there is a limit of one contact per day.
the news letter acts as a digital magazine for the college featuring news, articles interviews and even student achievements.
the limit is the sky with this kind of an app and features can be added here on by student and faculty reccomendations
